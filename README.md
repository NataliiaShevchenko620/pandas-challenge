# PyCity Schools Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis of PyCity Schools, including district-level and school-level summaries, performance comparisons, and additional insights.

## Overview

The analysis covers various aspects of PyCity Schools, including district and school summaries, performance metrics, and detailed breakdowns by grade, spending, size, and school type.

## Files

- **PyCitySchools.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis.

## Data Sources

- **schools_complete.csv**: CSV file containing information about schools.
- **students_complete.csv**: CSV file containing information about students.

## Dependencies

- Pandas
- Pathlib

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `PyCitySchools.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
2. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.
3. Execute the code cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
4. Review the district and school summaries, performance comparisons, and additional insights.

## Conclusions

1. The analysis reveals trends and patterns in the performance of PyCity Schools.
2. Consider the impact of various factors, such as school type, spending per student, and school size, on academic performance.
3. Detailed breakdowns by grade and subject provide a comprehensive view of student performance.

# Analysis Summary
1. **Average Reading Score** and **% Passing Reading** are higher than corresponded performance metrics for math
2. **School type** has the most significant influence on performance
3. For more correct analytics and conclusion we need to consider a **few factors together** rather than concentrate on those factors standalone
4. **Number of schools** in each group also influences on conclusions, therefore, it would be better to add this metric to all tables with grouped results
